## Motivation for building this app

Kandahar University, located in Kandahar, Afghanistan, had employees data stored across multiple spreadsheets.   As the university has no budget to spend on app like this, they asked me to help them with their data problem and make a central app for which should enable them to find the records instantly, based on different parameters.

So I took this opportunity to show case my web development skills through building something that can actually help someone.

<a name="What"/>
## What isn't it? 

This is not a traditional employee management system. This app does not have attendance, classes, subjects or any other sections, that you might expect in an employee management system. 

<a name="What's"/>
## What's it?

This app helps provide employees data through the report section through an easy to use interface. 

This app has the following sections: 

- Dashboard
- Employee
    - Basic Information
    - Education/Degree Details (Bachelor, Masters, Ph.D.)
    - Academic Ranks (Assistant Prof. Associate Prof. Professor, etc.)
    - Address Info
    - Profile
    - Attachment/Documents
- Reports  ( Filtering records based on different parameters )
- Faculties
- Departments
- University (which is the name of the app)
- Settings

All of the above, are just different CRUD operations connected with each other logically.

The requirements were collected from the Kandahar University only, but this app can be directly usable by all the universities across Afghanistan, because, all of these universities have the same administrative structure and work under the ministry of higher educations of Afghanistan.
